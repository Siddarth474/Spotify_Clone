 Just wrapped up building my own Spotify Clone! 🎉

After diving deep into React.js and Tailwind CSS, I decided to challenge myself with a music streaming web app – and here it is: a fully functional Spotify Clone!

🛠️ What’s inside?

 🎵 Music Playback – Smooth play, pause, next/prev functionality

 📱 Responsive UI – Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop

 ✅ Dynamic Navigation – Easily jump to specific albums

 ⚛️ Context API – For global state management like current playing track    and playback status

 ✅ Section Toggle – Easily switch to music or podcast section

 ✅ Modern Design – Inspired by Spotify’s sleek, intuitive layout

 💡 Reusable Components – Clean, scalable code structure with proper state management using hooks

📚 This project helped me improve my understanding of React components, props/state, Tailwind utility classes, and responsive design principles. It also gave me hands-on experience in building real-world UI/UX features like media playback and route-based navigation.
